#AppleToo

**AppleToo** is an Apple II emulator written in JavaScript. It currently
supports all 151 opcodes for the original 6502 CPU, high-resolution graphics
mode, full-screen text mode, keyboard input, and a disassembler.

It's not complete and still has bugs, but you can boot and play games,
including _Spy's Demise_.
