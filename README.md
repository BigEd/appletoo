#AppleToo

**AppleToo** is an Apple II emulator written in JavaScript. It currently
supports all 151 opcodes for the original 6502 CPU, high-resolution graphics
mode, full-screen text mode, keyboard input, and a disassembler.

It's not complete and still has bugs, but you can boot and play games,
including _Spy's Demise_.

## Usage

You'll need ROM files to use AppleToo (you can find ROMs pretty easily with
a little Googling). 

## TODO

 - Finish disk controller
 - Audio
 - Implement other graphics and text modes (low-res, mixed, etc)
 - 65C02 opcodes
